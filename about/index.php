    <p>Me? I&#39;m a goofball. I&#39;m sarcastic, fun and witty, but I can be serious when I need to be. I care about things. I care about people. The most important thing is the user and the fact that semantic code and tasteful design make a better experience is just a side effect. I&#39;m super attentive to details and I love doing things the right way.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve been into web for years. I worked at overstock.com as a web designer and shifted to front&ndash;end development. Working for a billion dollar company completely opened my paradigm helping me understand how to function in the real world of large corporations.</p>
    <p>I currently work for a start&ndash;up called Candeo as Director of Technology where I wear literally 10 hats. Spreading thin isn&#39;t what I necessarily want or like but it stretches and pushes me to learn new skills.</p>
